STROBO-2TORS: deliberately narrow first proof layer.

This file establishes algebraic prerequisites for the proposed triple-support
classification. It does NOT claim to establish the complete fibre bound or the
classification/counting theorem.

The coefficient below is the explicit nine-ordered-pair expansion of the
convolution square of a three-element support {a,b,c}, when its entries are
pairwise distinct. Thus diagonal terms have coefficient 1 and the three
off-diagonal pair sums have coefficient 2.
